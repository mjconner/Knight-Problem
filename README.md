# Knight-Problem
Given a start and end position, the board size, and the ability to move like a traditional knight chess piece, find the shortest number of moves to travel to the end location.

The board will be size <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> where <i>n</i> is specified by the program user. For example, if <i>n = 4</i>:

|| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 ||
|| 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 ||
|| 8 || 9 || 10|| 11||
|| 12|| 13|| 14|| 15||

Where it would take one move to get from location 0 to location 9 or from location 0 to location 6, for instance.
